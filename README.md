## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with vanilla JavaScript (no build tools)
- **Backend**: Electron with Node.js ES modules
- **Roon Integration**: Official Roon API libraries
- **Storage**: electron-store for persistent settings

### File Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js              # Electron main process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roonService.js       # Roon API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ipcHandlers.js       # IPC communication layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preload.cjs          # Secure IPC bridge
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ renderer/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # Main UI template
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js         # React application
```

### API Integration
The app uses official Roon Labs API libraries:
- `node-roon-api` - Core connection and discovery
- `node-roon-api-browse` - Music library browsing
- `node-roon-api-transport` - Playback control
- `node-roon-api-image` - Album art retrieval

## Development

### Prerequisites
```bash
node --version  # Should be 16.0.0 or higher
npm --version   # Should be 8.0.0 or higher
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for distribution
npm run make

# Package without building installer
npm run package
```

### Building for Distribution
The app uses Electron Forge for building:
```bash
# Create DMG for macOS
npm run make

# Output will be in ./out/make/
```

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved to:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/com.markmcc.roonrandom.plist`

The app stores:
- Roon Core pairing token
- Last selected zone
- Genre filter preferences
- Window position and size

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Can't find Roon Core**: Ensure Roon Core and the app are on the same network
- **Extension not appearing**: Check Roon Settings ‚Üí Extensions and look for "Roon Random Album"
- **Pairing fails**: Try restarting both Roon Core and the app

### Playback Issues
- **No zones available**: Ensure you have audio devices configured in Roon
- **Transport controls don't work**: Check that your selected zone supports the requested operation
- **No albums found**: Verify you have music in your Roon library and try refreshing genres

### Performance
- **Slow genre loading**: Large libraries may take time to scan; this is cached for 1 hour
- **App becomes unresponsive**: Restart the app and check Roon Core connectivity
